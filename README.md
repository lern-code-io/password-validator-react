# password-validator
Add an onChange handler to the input box in the App component that will validate the input. This validation should check if the length of the password is at least 8 characters. If the password is 8 characters or more then the text "Strong Password" should appear in green below the input box.  If the password is less than 8 characters, then the text "Password is too short" should appear in red below the input box. If the input box is empty, then no message should be shown.
